RF and Microwave Switches Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030

The global RF and Microwave Switches market was valued at US$ 3505.6 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 6250.8 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

An RF switch or microwave switch is a device to route high frequency signals through transmission paths. RF (radio frequency) and microwave switches are used extensively in microwave test systems for signal routing between instruments and devices under test (DUT). Incorporating a switch into a switch matrix system enables you to route signals from multiple instruments to single or multiple DUTs. This allows multiple tests to be performed with the same setup, eliminating the need for frequent connects and disconnects. The entire testing process can be automated, increasing the throughput in high-volume production environments.
